# Pre-Post-5G-Launch-AtliQo-

This project is a part of the **Codebasics Resume Project Challenge**, where we analyze AtliQo's business performance using real-world datasets. AtliQo, a telecom company, launched its 5G services in **May 2022**. However, the launch was followed by a significant **drop in revenue, active users, and market share**. This project aims to uncover the underlying causes using data analysis and visualization techniques, and provide **data-driven recommendations** to support business recovery.

## KPIs Analyzed

We compared metrics from:

* **Pre-5G period:** January to April 2022
* **Post-5G period:** June to September 2022

**Analyzed KPIs include:**

## Key Insights

1. **Revenue and ARPU Declined:** Post-5G launch, both overall revenue and ARPU dropped, indicating either poor adoption or customers downgrading.
2. **Unsubscribed Users Increased:** Many users left the network, possibly due to dissatisfaction or poor onboarding.
3. **Market Share Lost:** Competitors gained ground in key regions during AtliQoâ€™s transition phase.
4. **Active Users Dropped:** Engagement and usage dipped significantly after the 5G rollout.
